Web Crawler: Implement the web crawler as discussed earlier to gather stock market data and store it in a suitable format, such as a database.

ChatGPT API: Set up the integration with the ChatGPT API, which allows you to send user queries and receive AI-generated responses. You'll need to sign up for an API key and follow the API documentation provided by OpenAI to make API requests.

Backend Server: Build a backend server application that acts as an intermediary between the client and the ChatGPT API. This server will receive client queries, fetch relevant data from the crawler's database, send the query to the ChatGPT API, and return the AI-generated response to the client.

Client Interface: Develop a client-facing interface, such as a web page or a mobile app, where users can enter their queries or engage in a chat conversation. This interface should communicate with the backend server to send queries and display the responses received.

Query Processing: When the backend server receives a user query, it can process the query to understand the user's intent and extract relevant information. Based on the query, the server can retrieve the corresponding stock market data from the crawler's database.

API Request: Once the server has the necessary information, it can construct an API request to the ChatGPT API, including the user's query and any additional context or data that might be relevant for generating the response.

AI Response: Send the API request to the ChatGPT API and receive the AI-generated response. This response can be in the form of text, which the server can further process if needed.
