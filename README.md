# Stock Market with ChatGpt

There are many stock information websites and apps in the market, so accessing stock market information has become easier and faster than the past.
Anyone can easily navigate websites like Yahoo Finance. However, when newcomers enter such websites, they might get stuck wondering where to start.
For instance, just looking up information on well-known companies like Apple can be quite confusing.
Even for experienced users, setting up to compare and anlayze stock information for various companies can be time-consuming.

Thanks to the advancement of natural language processing models like ChatGPT, we can see cases of improved user experiences applied in various fields.
If ChatGPT were to be applied to a stock information app, it could potentially make it more user-friendly, allowing many people to find stock information
more easily and quickly.

This project encompasees web scraping, data storage, work scheduling and orcherstration, web server hosting and web application using AWS cloud service.
Addtionally, a chat-based interface for users to interact with the stock information database using ChatGPT has been implemented.

## Overview

- **Web Crawler**: An automated web crawler gathers stock market data from various sources and stores it in a database.

- **ChatGPT API**: The system integrates with the OpenAI ChatGPT API, allowing users to send queries and receive AI-generated responses.

- **Backend Server**: A backend server application acts as an intermediary between the client and the ChatGPT API. It receives user queries, fetches relevant data from the crawler's database, sends the query to the ChatGPT API, and returns the AI-generated response to the client.

- **Client Interface**: A user-friendly web or mobile interface allows users to enter queries and engage in chat-based conversations. The interface communicates with the backend server to send queries and display responses.

- **Query Processing**: The backend server processes user queries to understand intent and extract relevant information. It retrieves stock market data from the crawler's database based on user queries.

## Components

### 1. Web Crawler

The web crawler is responsible for collecting stock market data from various sources, such as financial news websites and stock exchange websites. It stores this data in a suitable format, such as a database, for easy retrieval.

### 2. ChatGPT API

The system leverages the OpenAI ChatGPT API to provide natural language processing capabilities. Users can interact with the system by sending queries and receiving responses generated by the AI model.

### 3. Backend Server

The backend server acts as a bridge between the client interface and the ChatGPT API. It handles user requests, processes queries, retrieves relevant data from the database, sends queries to the ChatGPT API, and returns responses to the client.

### 4. Client Interface

Users access the system through a user-friendly interface, which can be a web application or a mobile app. This interface allows users to enter queries and engage in chat conversations.
