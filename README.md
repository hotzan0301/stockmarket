# Stock Market with ChatGpt

This project combines web scraping, data storage, and the OpenAI ChatGPT API to create a chat-based interface for accessing stock market data.

## Overview

- **Web Crawler**: An automated web crawler gathers stock market data from various sources and stores it in a database.

- **ChatGPT API**: The system integrates with the OpenAI ChatGPT API, allowing users to send queries and receive AI-generated responses.

- **Backend Server**: A backend server application acts as an intermediary between the client and the ChatGPT API. It receives user queries, fetches relevant data from the crawler's database, sends the query to the ChatGPT API, and returns the AI-generated response to the client.

- **Client Interface**: A user-friendly web or mobile interface allows users to enter queries and engage in chat-based conversations. The interface communicates with the backend server to send queries and display responses.

- **Query Processing**: The backend server processes user queries to understand intent and extract relevant information. It retrieves stock market data from the crawler's database based on user queries.

## Components

### 1. Web Crawler

The web crawler is responsible for collecting stock market data from various sources, such as financial news websites and stock exchange websites. It stores this data in a suitable format, such as a database, for easy retrieval.

### 2. ChatGPT API

The system leverages the OpenAI ChatGPT API to provide natural language processing capabilities. Users can interact with the system by sending queries and receiving responses generated by the AI model.

### 3. Backend Server

The backend server acts as a bridge between the client interface and the ChatGPT API. It handles user requests, processes queries, retrieves relevant data from the database, sends queries to the ChatGPT API, and returns responses to the client.

### 4. Client Interface

Users access the system through a user-friendly interface, which can be a web application or a mobile app. This interface allows users to enter queries and engage in chat conversations.
